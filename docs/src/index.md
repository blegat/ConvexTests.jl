# ConvexTests.jl


Uses the Convex.jl [Problem Depot](https://www.juliaopt.org/Convex.jl/stable/problem_depot/) to test various
optimization solvers. See the sidebar for the solvers test results.

Note that some of the problems are fairly strange (e.g. only one feasible
point), which can be difficult for solvers to handle.
